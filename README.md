# Note Taker

## Introduction 
For this project we were assigned to finish a Note Taking app that utilzed Express.js. Users should be able to save notes for themselves by typing in the text area and clicking the save button. Note titles that are saved to the left hand side can be clicked to display the note text.

I did not utilize the delete button but will revisit as soon as I can. 

## Disclaimer/ Credits
I heavily relied on the student activities 18 and 20 from the week-06 11-Express folder to complete this assignment.

## Installation
Users can utilize the heroku url to interact with this app. If they want to run it on their local host they will need to download the packages for this app by typing "npm i" into the integrated terminal and then running the command "nodemon server.js" to begin the local host listening.
